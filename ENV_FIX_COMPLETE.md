# ✅ Environment Variables Fix - COMPLETE

## What I Fixed

The issue was that Vite's `root` is set to the `client` folder, but your `.env` file is in the project root. Vite was looking for `.env` in the wrong location.

## ✅ Solution Applied

I added this line to `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
envDir: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname),
```

This tells Vite to load environment variables from the project root (where your `.env` file is located).

## 🔄 CRITICAL: You MUST Restart the Dev Server

Environment variables are **only loaded when the server starts**. You need to:

1. **Stop the current dev server**:
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

2. **Start it again**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Wait for it to fully start** (should open browser automatically)

## 🧪 Test That It's Working

### Method 1: Check in Browser Console

1. Open the browser (should be at `http://localhost:5000`)
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the **Console** tab
4. Type this and press Enter:

```javascript
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY)
```

**Expected Result**: Should show `CoddUcOgIV1ASGycY`

**If it shows `undefined`**: Environment variables aren't loading

### Method 2: Test the Contact Form

1. Go to: `http://localhost:5000/contact`
2. Fill in the form:
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Message: Testing EmailJS
3. Click "Send Message"
4. **Expected**: ✅ Green toast saying "Message Sent!"
5. **If error**: Check browser console for details

### Method 3: Check WhatsApp Number

1. Go to: `http://localhost:5000/contact`
2. Look at the WhatsApp contact card
3. **Expected**: Should show `+2349160965661`
4. **If shows different number**: Environment variables not loaded

## 📋 Your .env File Should Contain

Make sure your `.env` file has these exact lines:

```env
# EmailJS Configuration
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_x29lji3
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_kgt44s5
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=CoddUcOgIV1ASGycY

# WhatsApp Configuration
VITE_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=+2349160965661
```

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### Issue 1: Still showing undefined
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you **fully stopped** the old server (Ctrl+C)
- Start fresh: `npm run dev`
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue 2: .env file in wrong location
**Check**: The `.env` file should be here:
```
JetGlide/
├── .env          ← HERE (same level as vite.config.ts)
├── vite.config.ts
├── package.json
├── client/
└── ...
```

### Issue 3: File has wrong content
**Fix**: Open `.env` and make sure it has the EmailJS and WhatsApp variables

### Issue 4: Typo in variable names
**Check**: Variable names must start with `VITE_` (all uppercase)

## 🎯 What Changed in vite.config.ts

**Before**:
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: { ... },
  root: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "client"),
  ...
});
```

**After**:
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  envDir: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname),  // ← ADDED THIS LINE
  resolve: { ... },
  root: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "client"),
  ...
});
```

This tells Vite: "Look for `.env` in the project root, not in the client folder"

## ✅ After Restart, Everything Should Work

Once you restart the dev server:
- ✅ EmailJS will work (contact form sends emails)
- ✅ WhatsApp number will show correctly (+2349160965661)
- ✅ No more "public key required" error
- ✅ Environment variables accessible throughout the app

## 🚀 Quick Restart Commands

**Stop server**: `Ctrl+C`

**Start server**: `npm run dev`

**Or restart in one command**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 📞 Verify These Work After Restart

1. **Contact Form**: Should send emails via EmailJS
2. **WhatsApp Buttons**: Should open WhatsApp with +2349160965661
3. **Contact Page**: Should show correct phone number
4. **No Console Errors**: Check browser console (F12)

## 🎉 Summary

**What was wrong**: Vite couldn't find `.env` because it was looking in the `client` folder

**What I fixed**: Added `envDir` to tell Vite where to find `.env`

**What you need to do**: **RESTART THE DEV SERVER** (Ctrl+C then `npm run dev`)

**How to verify**: Check browser console or test the contact form

---

**After restarting, your EmailJS integration should work perfectly!** ✅
