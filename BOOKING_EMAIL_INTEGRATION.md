# ✅ Booking Form Email Integration - Complete

## 🎉 What's Been Added

The booking form now sends emails via EmailJS, just like the contact form!

## ✅ How It Works

### When User Submits Booking Form:

1. **User fills the form**:
   - Full Name
   - Email
   - Phone
   - Departure City (From)
   - Destination (To)
   - Additional Notes (optional)

2. **User clicks "Submit Booking Request"**:
   - Form validates all required fields
   - Checks departure ≠ destination
   - Sends email via EmailJS
   - Shows success toast notification
   - Displays thank you message

3. **You receive an email** with:
   ```
   Booking Request:
   
   Name: [Customer Name]
   Email: [Customer Email]
   Phone: [Customer Phone]
   From: [Departure City]
   To: [Destination City]
   Additional Notes: [Notes or 'None']
   ```

## 📧 Email Configuration

**Uses the same EmailJS setup**:
- Service ID: `service_x29lji3`
- Template ID: `template_kgt44s5`
- Public Key: `CoddUcOgIV1ASGycY`

**Email fields sent**:
- `from_name`: Customer's full name
- `from_email`: Customer's email
- `message`: Complete booking details (formatted)
- `to_name`: "AirCambridge Jet Team"
